# console-finances
It was a really challenging assignment for me to be honest, but after a lot of practice I finally understand
the whole concept. We had a zoom session with my pod as well and I also had 2 tutoring sessions during
the Christmas break. I tried to do as many coding challenges as I could and practicing with the Grasshopper 
app too. I was focusing on iterating through arrays with for loops and did a lot of research on other concepts as well. I was trying to keep my code clean and readable. I'm looking for the upcoming challenges and to learn more about JavaScript. :)
