JavaScript Fundamentals

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

Tracking what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

(Total/(Number of months - 1))

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final code prints the analysis into the console.
